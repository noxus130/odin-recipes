# odin-recipes
Current project will test my current HTML knowledge by making a website for recipes
Should consist of main index page and links to recipes
Using GitHub will make it easier to create a new repo for the project
Once the repo has been made, move it to local machine using SSH link
The file should have a README.md file created on the GitHub repo
Once you cd into the odin-recipes file, you can use code . to open the file on VSC and edit the text file
This will take some getting used to
Use old lessons if needed and try to learn the commands by memory if possible
